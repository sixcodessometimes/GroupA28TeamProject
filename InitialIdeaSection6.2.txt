The CWUR scores of Asian and European universities differ significantly (p < 0.001), according to the Mann-Whitney U test.  European universities typically rank higher than those in Asia, according to the boxplot and test results.  This implies geographical differences in institutional prestige, educational quality, and research output.  These results show how geography may affect university performance, which may have an impact on global student choices and educational competitiveness.
